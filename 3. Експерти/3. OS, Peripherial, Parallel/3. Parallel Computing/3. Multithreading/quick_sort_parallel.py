Summary: Parallel quicksort versus sequential and built-in.
Using multiprocessing Process/Pipe.

Uses Process/Pipe paradigm to communicate the solutions to
the parent processes.

This code exemplifies the Process/Pipe paradigm of
parallel design.  Quicksort says:
-Partition the list according to a random pivot.
-Quicksort the left half-list.
-Quicksort the right half-list.
So a parallel version comes from the realization that
the two sorts are independent of one another after the
partition:
-Partition the list according to a random pivot.
-Quicksort the two half-lists in parallel.

This is not typical quicksort; it is NlogN in memory
and does not sort the argument lyst as a side effect,
but rather returns a sorted version of the lyst.

Using a shared memory array results in locks.  Even
with the additional memory, there is usually a
reasonable speedup here.
